# Search-Engine
 In this project, we aim to build a simple search engine from scratch and gain a deeper understanding of how it functions behind the scenes. The search engine will utilize Term Frequencies in its web crawling process using indexer, enabling efficient data retrieval.
 
-> Technologies used in this project include :

       • Front-end : HTML,CSS,JSP

       • Back-end : Java Servlets

       • Database : MySQL

       • Other Technologies used - IntelliJ IDEA, Maven Archetype, Tomcat Server, JDBC

-> The primary components of our search engine project are the front end, back end, and database.

-> The front end is responsible for the user interface, where users can interact with the search engine through a search bar and search button.

->The front-end design includes a web application with a simple search bar and a search button.  

->The search history of users is also displayed, allowing them to keep track of their previous searches.



-> web crawler :  A web crawler, or spider, is a type of bot that is typically operated by search engines . Their purpose is to index the content of websites all across the Internet so that those websites can appear in search engine results. The web crawler uses an algorithm called Limited Depth-First Search (DFS) to crawl through web pages systematically.

Indexing : Search engine indexing refers to the process where a search engine (such as Google) organizes and stores online content in a central database (its index). The search engine can then analyze and understand the content, and serve it to readers in ranked lists on its Search Engine Results Pages (SERPs).

Ranking : Rankings in SEO refers to a website’s position in the search engine results page.
